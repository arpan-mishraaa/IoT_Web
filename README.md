# IoT_Web
This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and Django, integrated with an IoT device for real-time health monitoring.
# MedX – Smart Health Monitoring Kit

**MedX** is a smart health monitoring kit designed to track and visualize real-time patient vitals using an IoT-enabled system. This repository contains the frontend of the MedX website and will later include the Django-based backend for full functionality.

## 🔧 Project Overview

This web application serves as the interface for a smart medical kit that monitors vital health parameters like:

- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Heart Rate (HR)
- Blood Sugar
- SpO₂ (Oxygen Saturation)
- Body Temperature

The system is integrated with an IoT device to provide real-time health data visualization and monitoring.

## 📁 Current Status

- ✅ **Frontend** – Built using **HTML** and **CSS** (included in the `IoT_web.zip` file)
- 🚧 **Backend** – Will be added soon (developed using **Django**)

## 👨‍🏫 Supervised By

This project is being developed under the guidance of **Professor Sudhanshu**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Django (coming soon)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing patient vitals)

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- Real-time vitals display from IoT sensors
- Patient data history and analysis
- Alerts for abnormal readings
